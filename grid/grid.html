             <p>In this website you were experience my technological childhood versus my daughters technological exposure. The website will follow for different age range categories that reflect time in the environment versus exposure to technology. I will show different activity is that I played with my friends and activities that are available to my daughter today like Facebook for kids and FaceTime with her friends and iPads where people can get a hold of her versus me having a landline playing three-way on the telephone that was connected to the wall and the actual face-to-face time that I valued so dearly as a child. I will explore different color themes as well as different profile picture elements. My daughters I will use an emoji type and for me I will use an actual photograph. I will also include audio for both the difference in music will hopefully also be illustrated. I will have an illustrated background like a gift and it will be an interactive profile type like my space MySpace was a personal profile where you could display your likes and I will illustrate it after such format. Instead of icons I will have photographs where you can see the different activities illustrated in our lives and the differences they take on.
