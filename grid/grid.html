For Alphas, it’s a way of life.”

                     They’ll have a digital presence before they’re even born. And their skills will become much more specialized.More than 40 percent predicted a negative outcome: The young wired brains will be easily distracted and move away from deep-thinking capabilities and face to face social skills.
                     As automation becomes even more refined, members of Generation Alpha will need to develop deeper skillsets to thrive in the changing job market.

                    <p style=" width: 630px; height: 390px; left: 750px;top:3600px; position:absolute; ">  Michael Merzenich, a neuroscientist and pioneer in brain plasticity research, told Hotwire that he hypothesizes that there will be an enormous focus on specialization, which could alter the physical makeup of the human brain and turn the Alphas into a class of “super-specialists.”
                 According to Hotwire, that could lead to cultural and social divides, “with a ‘superclass’ of individuals taking highly specialized roles while others are left without meaningful work.”
