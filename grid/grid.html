             <p1>Experience my technological childhood!
               I am a millennial (1980 to 1995) and I am comparing my daughters technological exposure as an Alpha to mine.
                technological activities that are available to my daughter today like Facebook for kids and FaceTime with her friends and iPads where people can get a hold of her versus me having a landline playing three-way on the telephone that was connected to the wall and the actual face-to-face time that I valued so dearly as a child are a stark differnce that I will highlight and the differences they take on.

                     <p style=" width: 630px; height: 390px; left: 750px;top:2400px; position:absolute; ">The Alphas are the first generation to be born entirely in the 21st century and, as such, they will be the most tech-infused demographic to date. “Gen Zs, the group born between 1995 and 2010, grew up when social media was being established,” notes business strategy group Flux Trends. “For them, it’s a tool. For Alphas, it’s a way of life.”

                        They’ll have a digital presence before they’re even born. And their skills will become much more specialized.More than 40 percent predicted a negative outcome: The young wired brains will be easily distracted and move away from deep-thinking capabilities and face to face social skills.
                        As automation becomes even more refined, members of Generation Alpha will need to develop deeper skillsets to thrive in the changing job market. Michael Merzenich, a neuroscientist and pioneer in brain plasticity research, told Hotwire that he hypothesizes that there will be an enormous focus on specialization, which could alter the physical makeup of the human brain and turn the Alphas into a class of “super-specialists.”
                        According to Hotwire, that could lead to cultural and social divides, “with a ‘superclass’ of individuals taking highly specialized roles while others are left without meaningful work.”
