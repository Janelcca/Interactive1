  <h2>The Mission District </h2>
        <a id = "Cake"> </a>
        <p>An interesting hipster neighborhood that is fun to stroll around in. It is full of graffiti, street art,
          interesting people, shops, cafes, restaurants, and boutiques. My daughter and I hang out in this neighborhood a lot.
          They have a fabulous farmers market and the best food.
          <br>
          One of our favorite resturants is MYRIAD. It serves globally inspired food and drinks in The Mission
          in a relaxed and kid friendly environment. It has a hip vibe with a long wait but great service.
          It is a modern mission resturant(genterfication) and the mission is my favorite neighborhood in San Francisco

  <h2>Mission Dolores Park</h2>
          <a id = "graffiti"> </a>
          <p>
            Mission Dolores Park is one of my favorite parks in the mission.
            The mission is also always warmer than the rest of San Francisco,
            There are so many parks to choose from this is my daughters
            favorite place to play.It is close to Biright (fav grocery store) and Ice Cream!
            My dream is to own a piece of property
            in the Mission on day.
