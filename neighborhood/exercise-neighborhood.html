        <h2> Mission street is </h2>
<p> An interesting hipster neighborhood
   that is fun to stroll around in.It is full of graffiti, street art,
          interesting people, shops, cafes, restaurants, and boutiques. My daughter and I hang out in this neighborhood a lot.
          They have a fabulous farmers market and the best food.

          <h2>Myriad</h2>
          <p>
          One of our favorite resturants is MYRIAD. It serves globally inspired food and drinks in The Mission
          in a relaxed and kid friendly environment. It has a hip vibe with a long wait but great service.
          It is a modern mission resturant(genterfication) and the mission is my favorite neighborhood in San Francisco
          I live in Bernal heights
          which is about a 10 to 15 minute walk.

            <h1>Mission Dolores Park</h1>
            <p> is one of my favorite parks in the mission.
            The mission is also always warmer than the rest of San Francisco,
            There are so many parks to choose from this is my daughters
            favorite place to play.It is close to Biright (fav grocery store) and Ice Cream!
            My dream is to own a piece of property
            in the Mission on day.I am working on saving my million so I can achive this dream...Hehe

            <p> is between Mission and Valencia Streets at 24th Street.
            It is two blocks long and is located by the Bart Station.,
            It is a leagal space that street artist can expessthemsels and onlookers can marvel.</p>

            <h1>Street art in the mission</h1>
              <p> the Mission Districtâ€™s social movements shaped
              San Francisco into the revolutionary city it is today.
              large-scale murals and graffiti took off in the Mission in the 1980'
              along with the views on commercialization
              of street art, and the terminology of the spray can world.
              Mission is home to stunning political street art,created by feminists,
              Latinx communities and neighborhood activists whom have fought,
              and continue to fight, to keep the soul of SF alive in the face
              of gentrification and preserving local culture.

              <h2> La Taqeria </h2>
              <p>Seriously the absolute best taco in the universe in my opinion.
              La Taqeria is rated the best taco in San Francisco. The line is
              out the door and down the street daily.
