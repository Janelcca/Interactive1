      <h2>The Mission District </h2> <p>An interesting hipster neighborhood <br> that is fun to stroll around in. It is full of graffiti, street art,<br>
       interesting people, shops, cafes, restaurants, and boutiques.</p><p2> The mission is my favorite neighborhood in San Francisco<br>

<p>Delores park is one of my favorite parks in the mission. <br>
The mission is also always warmer than the rest of San Francisco,There are so many parks to choose from this is my daughters<br>
 favorite place to play. My dream is to own a piece of property in the Mission on day.<br></p>
