      <h2>The Mission District </h2> <p>An interesting hipster neighborhood <br> that is fun to stroll around in. It is full of graffiti, street art,<br>
       interesting people, shops, cafes, restaurants, and boutiques. My daughter and I hang out in this neighborhood a lot.<br>
     They have a fabulous farmers market and the best food. </p><p2>One of our favorite resturants is MYRIAD. It serves globally inspired food and drinks in The Mission <br>
        in a relaxed and kid friendly environment. It has a hip vibe with a long wait but great service. <br>
         It is a modern mission resturant(genterfication) and the mission is my favorite neighborhood in San Francisco<br>

<h2>Mission Dolores Park</h2>
<p>Mission Dolores Park is one of my favorite parks in the mission. <br>
The mission is also always warmer than the rest of San Francisco,<br>
There are so many parks to choose from this is my daughters<br>
 favorite place to play.It is close to Biright (fav grocery store) and Ice Cream!<br>
  My dream is to own a piece of property<br>
 in the Mission on day.<br></p>
