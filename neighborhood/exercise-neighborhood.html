      <h2>The Mission District </h2> <p>An interesting hipster neighborhood <br> that is fun to stroll around in. It is full of graffiti, street art,<br>
       interesting people, shops, cafes, restaurants, and boutiques.</p><p2> The mission is my favorite neighborhood in San Francisco I live in Bernal<br>
      which is about a 10 to 15 minute walk. The best tacos and burritos live in the Mission as well as the best donut dynamo donuts are my favorite hands-down.<br>
      The mission is also always warmer than the rest of San Francisco and the traffic is always heavy. There are so many parks to choose from this is my daughters<br>
       favorite place to play. It is a very lively neighborhood and there is plenty to do on foot my dream is to own a piece of property in the Mission.<br>
