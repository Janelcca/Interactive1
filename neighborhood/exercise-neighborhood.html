<p>The mission is also always warmer than the rest of San Francisco and the traffic is always heavy. There are so many parks to choose from this is my daughters<br>
 favorite place to play. It is a very lively neighborhood and there is plenty to do on foot my dream is to own a piece of property in the Mission.<br></p>
